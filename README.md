Nazca Design
============

Nazca is an open-source Photonic integrated Circuit (PIC) design tool running under Python-3. 
Nazca makes design simpler and more fun by adding many features to deliver high-quality designs efficiently. 
Such as embedding hierarchical design in the script syntax, supporting visualisation schemes in mask layout, connection and connectivity valdidation, and logging of layout information with code references, among many others. For gds file layout viewing designers can e.g. utilize the freely available Klayout mask viewer/editor.
